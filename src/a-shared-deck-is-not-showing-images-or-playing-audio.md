# A shared deck is not showing images/playing audio

Some shared decks are missing sounds or images, either because the author expects you to download them from a separate location, or because they've accidentally or deliberately omitted them.

When downloading a shared deck from AnkiWeb, the number of included sounds and images is listed near the top of the download page.

If you've downloaded a shared deck from somewhere other than AnkiWeb and media files are not working, please contact the sharer for assistance.

We've received a number of questions about this deck. Some Googling revealed the following:

You may know someone who's downloaded that deck with working images. This would either be because they got it from somewhere else in the past, or they downloaded it before the images were removed. Currently the downloads on Brosencephalon's website do not contain any images, so all image links in the deck will show up broken.
