# A deck I want has disappeared from AnkiWeb

The shared decks on AnkiWeb are provided by other Anki users. If the deck author has chosen to remove a shared deck, the deck has been deleted from our servers, and we do not have the ability to restore it.

Shared decks may also be hidden from view for other reasons, such as their copyright status needing to be confirmed. For legal reasons, we can not restore decks in these cases until we hear back from the deck author.
