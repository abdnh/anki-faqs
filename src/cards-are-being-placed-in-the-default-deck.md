# Cards are being placed in the "Default" deck

This is usually caused by an AnkiDroid bug, but can happen for other reasons as well. To fix the problem, please click the Cards button while adding a card, select the card type you're having trouble with via the tabs at the top, and ensure Options>Deck Override (More>Deck Override on Anki 2.0) is turned off.
