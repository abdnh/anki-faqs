# How do I move cards between decks?

You may want to move cards between decks for a variety of reasons, for example:

- you accidentally put them in the wrong deck
- you made a single large deck and want to break it into several smaller ones
- you made several small decks and want to combine them into a larger one

The [browser](https://docs.ankiweb.net/browsing.html) offers a **Change Deck** option in the menu bar for these kinds of tasks.

See also [Merging/combining two decks](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/merging-or-combining-two-decks.html#mergingcombining-two-decks) for more precise instructions for that exact situation.

If you want to move cards between _profiles_, or share cards with other people, you can use Anki's [export](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html) function to export a packaged deck. If you want to share or move to a new profile only some of the cards in a deck, you can first use the change deck option above to move them into a temporary deck, then export that deck.
