# Requesting a refund for AnkiMobile

If you're having problems with AnkiMobile, please let us know and we'll do our best to help you resolve them.

When you purchase items on the app store, Apple sell the product to you. As we are not involved in the sales process, we do not have the ability to offer you a refund as we have no access to your payment details - Apple does not even tell us who is purchasing the app. For this reason, any refund requests need to be submitted to Apple directly. Please see the following page for more information:
