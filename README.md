Arabic translation of [ankitects/faqs](https://github.com/ankitects/faqs). Work in progress; contributions are welcome.

## Tips

If you're unsure how to translate an Anki-specific term, I've compiled a small list of term translations
that should be used consistently through the FAQ pages and the [manual](github.com/abdnh/anki-manual/): [terms.md](https://github.com/abdnh/anki-manual/blob/main/terms.md).
